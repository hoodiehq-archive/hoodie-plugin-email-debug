# Debug Email

Listens for outgoing email snd records them into the `plugin/email-debug` database.

Sets up a webhook (currently hardcoded for the Mandrill format) and records responses into the `plugin/email-debug` database.

A clever view function allows to list all outgoinng mails with their delivery status(es). The view result shows for which emails there is no status, so you can investiate further.

```js
function(doc) {
  if(doc.type == 'email-debug') {
    var id = doc._id.split('/')[1];
    emit([doc.createdAt, doc.createdBy], {_id: 'mandrill/' + id + '-0'});
  }
}
```

There can be more than one event per email, we enumerate them with `-1`, `-2` etc.

TODO: Using the map function above we only get the first event for an email from mandrill. Iâ€™d say secondary ones can be fetched by an admin interface specifically.
